Graphically Speaking: Unmasking Abuse in Social Media with Conversation Insights

arXiv:2504.01902

We introduce a graph-based approach to Abusive Language Detection (ALD) that models Reddit conversations as graphs, capturing both content and structural context. Our method leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to outperform traditional context-agnostic and linear context-aware models.

📥 Dataset Preparation

1. Download the CAD Dataset
We utilize the Contextual Abuse Dataset (CAD) introduced by Vidgen et al. (NAACL 2021). The dataset includes annotated Reddit conversations with abuse labels contextualized within conversation threads.

Download the dataset from the GitHub repository or the associated Zenodo link provided therein.

2. Extract Full Reddit Conversations
To reconstruct full Reddit conversation threads, we recommend using the Arctic Shift project:
GitHub

Project Arctic Shift: arctic-shift.photon-reddit.com
GitHub Repository: ArthurHeitmann/arctic_shift
This tool provides access to archived Reddit data, allowing for the extraction of complete conversation threads necessary for our graph-based modeling.

Note: Due to Reddit's data policies, full conversation data may not be publicly distributable. Researchers interested in accessing the reconstructed conversations used in our study may contact us directly for potential collaboration.

🏃 Running the Code

1. Preprocess the Data
Ensure that the CAD dataset and the extracted Reddit conversations are placed appropriately within the data/ directory. Use the provided scripts to preprocess and prepare the data:

python data/create_balanced_ds.py
python data/split-indices.py
2. Train the Model
Initiate model training using the provided batch script:

bash cmd/run_train.batch
This script will train the GNN model on the prepared dataset, utilizing the configurations specified in cmd/experiments.py.

3. Evaluate the Model
After training, evaluate the model's performance:

bash cmd/run_eval.batch
For CPU-based evaluation, use:

bash cmd/run_eval_cpu.batch
Evaluation metrics and results will be outputted to the console and saved as specified in the evaluation scripts.

📊 Visualizations and Analysis

To analyze and visualize attention weights and graph structures:

python cmd/display_attention_weights.py
python cmd/analyze_graphs.py
These scripts provide insights into the model's focus areas and the structural properties of the conversation graphs.
